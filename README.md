Scaladoc

A minimal, source-centric API for building an object model from a serialized JSON Object, with implementations for most Java parsers.

## Purpose

<p>The <em>JsonRead</em> API is meant for a client that must parse a JSON document
and be able to access the JSON Values it contains.

<p>The <em>JsonRead</em> API is not meant as a way to easily access from the Java Language 
values serialized in a JSON document (Eg: no specialized accessors like getBoolean()) but
more as a way to explore the JSON document structure.
